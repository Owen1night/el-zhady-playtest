# Current isolated review draft

This branch is the unmerged, undeployed archive/solo-practice update for **Owen1night/el-zhady-playtest**, draft [PR #1](https://github.com/Owen1night/el-zhady-playtest/pull/1). Earlier release notes below describe prior stages and do not establish this draft as deployed.

- [Review, actual projector behavior and test evidence](REVIEW_VERIFICATION.md)
- [All seven exact image records and reuse rights](ARCHIVE_MEDIA.md)
- [Solo architecture, pending migration and later laptop/iPhone checklist](PRACTICE_SETUP.md)

Local public-reading preview: `npm ci`, `npm run dev` (then open the Vite URL). Static preview: `npm run build`, `npm run preview`. Without the reviewed new backend migration/configuration the practice service is unavailable; there are no fake scores. Do not point this branch at production. This task has not deployed a new public preview.

Checks: `npm run check`, `npm test`, `npm run check:media`, `npm run check:mixed-content`, `npm run check:solo-content`, `npm run build`. Browser fixtures: `npm run test:learning:browser`, `npm run test:practice:browser`; use a disposable PostgreSQL 17 service on **loopback port 55433**, `LIVE_QUIZ_TEST_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres@127.0.0.1:55433/postgres` for independent-connection races and `npm run test:mixed:browser`. Never pass a hosted connection URL. Each fixture creates/deletes only its own temporary local database. `BROWSER=webkit` selects WebKit for learning/practice when installed.

# Isolated PR #6 playtest — setup in progress

This is **Owen1night/el-zhady-playtest**, the disposable laptop/iPhone test repository. No playable site is deployed yet. Application code and migrations are pinned to PR #6 commit `465574fcc86f44b9d166c998c28a2e0d00a73b25`; the isolated setup kit was copied from `78909c2863a997637d6e6484f69a9bdea17c62c3`.

Use [playtest/SETUP_STATUS.md](playtest/SETUP_STATUS.md) for current progress and [the complete remaining checklist](playtest/REMAINING_CHECKLIST.md) for setup, wait gates and laptop/iPhone acceptance. The original isolated recipe remains in [playtest/README.md](playtest/README.md). Only the manual **Deploy isolated playtest** workflow applies here. A fresh separate Supabase project is still required; do not use production configuration. Expected future URL: `https://owen1night.github.io/el-zhady-playtest/` (not verified live).

The source repository, its PR #5/PR #6 and production Supabase/Cron/Pages are unchanged. The older implementation notes below are inherited reference documentation, **not instructions to deploy this test repository to production**.

# Mixed live challenges — second draft

Branch `codex/mixed-live-challenges` builds on PR #5. Suggested quiz → map → timeline; custom supported orders; 50-task bank; persisted room-wide nonrepetition/capacity failure; normalized equal maxima; target-specific host «Сұрақты аяқтау». See MIXED_SCORING.md, MIXED_SETUP.md and MIXED_VERIFICATION.md. Production and hosted SQL/Cron are unchanged. The first slice can be reviewed/released separately. Local build preview: `npm run build && npm run preview -- --port 4173`; public readings work without backend config, but new live games need the reviewed new backend or `npm run test:mixed:browser` with the disposable local service. No public PR preview URL is claimed.

# Current draft: first playtest slice

Production remains the PR #4 release (`e60d7d4`). Branch `codex/learning-and-player-labels` adds desktop/mobile «Ойынға қосылу», replaces visible join ordinals with explicitly labelled opaque identity tags and earned-place labels, and publishes the first sourced reading collection. It needs no SQL or Cron change. This draft is not deployed. Run `node --import tsx scripts/testing/learning-browser.ts` for 360px/1920px Chromium checks; use `npm run preview -- --port 4173` after build. See PLAYTEST_UPDATE.md. The older competition-implementation notes below describe the previous delivery and are historical.

# el-zhady

«Ел жады: Қазақстан, 1939–1953» — Kazakh-language university history website.

**Public deployed baseline:** https://owen1night.github.io/el-zhady/ — Stage 3 main `f291792`.

**Current work:** competition lifecycle update on `codex/live-competition-lifecycle`, for a draft PR only. Nothing from this update has been merged, deployed or applied to hosted Supabase. The museum identity, public history routes, Google/private profiles, genuine anonymous guest joining and GitHub Pages hosting remain intact. Independent practice, the other four activities and narrative/media collections remain unfinished.

The draft adds distinct removal/blocking, final close/deletion with saved history, projector QR expansion, one to three quiz-only rounds with a frozen roster, explicit next-round/final-result controls, protected host/player result views, a staged tied podium and a private 20-question bank with ten-question persisted draws.

## Local development and production preview

Node.js 22+ and npm:

```bash
cd /workspace/el-zhady
npm ci
npm run check
npm test
npm run build
npm run dev -- --port 5173
```

Use your own clone path if different. Exact production-build preview command:

```bash
npm run preview -- --port 4173
```

Open `http://localhost:4173` on the machine running it. This is local QA, not a public cloud preview or deployment. Missing/unreachable Supabase keeps public history readable and shows finite service errors; it never substitutes mock production profiles/results.

`check` runs TypeScript and public editorial-structure checks. `test` runs existing client/config/OAuth-subpath/Stage 2/3 baseline suites plus the new migration/upgrade/privacy/lifecycle suite in fresh disposable databases. `build` rejects private question prompts/IDs/seed markers in browser JS. No lint script exists.

For actual PostgreSQL connections, use the disposable loopback service described in [COMPETITION_VERIFICATION.md](COMPETITION_VERIFICATION.md):

```bash
LIVE_QUIZ_TEST_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres@127.0.0.1:55433/postgres npm run test:competition
LIVE_QUIZ_TEST_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres@127.0.0.1:55433/postgres npm run test:competition:browser
```

`test:live:browser` aliases the current runner. Chromium uses `/usr/bin/chromium`, optional `CHROMIUM_EXECUTABLE_PATH`, or a Playwright-installed browser. Three separate contexts execute real SQL/RLS through test-only Auth/REST fixtures; these do not establish hosted Supabase/Google/Realtime/Cron or physical-device success. CI uses PostgreSQL 17 and Node22. Test fixtures never enter the application bundle or real project.

## Backend status and new manual setup

The owner reports the original three migrations successfully applied manually and existing Cron verified. **Never edit or rerun those applied files or recreate Cron jobs.** Current status: [supabase/MIGRATION_STATUS.md](supabase/MIGRATION_STATUS.md).

The draft requires only **two new migrations**, neither applied remotely by this task. [COMPETITION_SETUP.md](COMPETITION_SETUP.md) gives exact SQL Editor steps, the precheck for zero running quizzes, coordinated maintenance/matching frontend requirements, read-only schema/privacy/Cron checks and a laptop/iPhone checklist. Do not apply production changes merely because the draft CI passes; the API/result contract changes require a separately approved coordinated release.

Existing [SUPABASE_SETUP.md](SUPABASE_SETUP.md) and [STAGE3_SETUP.md](STAGE3_SETUP.md) are historical setup references. Keep `el_zhady_private` outside exposed schemas. Existing owner admin grants/Auth/CAPTCHA/OAuth settings remain; grant future admins only via guarded owner SQL using permanent Auth UIDs, never display names/metadata.

Copy `.env.example` to ignored `.env.local` for local authenticated work. Only public values belong in frontend/build configuration:

- `VITE_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`: `https://owen1night.github.io/el-zhady/`, never localhost.
- `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`: actual project HTTPS URL.
- `VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`: public publishable or legacy anon key.
- `VITE_TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY`: public site key when CAPTCHA is enabled.

No service-role key, OAuth/CAPTCHA secret, database/admin password belongs in browser code, build variables or Git. Secrets remain managed by Supabase. This update needs no new variable, provider, backend host or visitor payment.

## Later release (not authorised by this draft task)

1. Review the PR/new SQL; follow COMPETITION_SETUP.md during a coordinated release window or on a disposable test project. Record actual application status. Do not run a blanket CLI `db push` against un-reconciled manual migration history.
2. Keep GitHub **Settings → Pages → Build and deployment → Source → GitHub Actions** and the four public Actions variables above. No private credential is needed for the static build.
3. Only after separate approval, merge to `main`. The existing `.github/workflows/pages.yml` deploys on main push/manual dispatch; PR CI does not deploy or migrate.
4. Monitor both jobs AND the public HTTPS health step, which checks the published commit marker and all25 built files against SHA-256. Then test actual Google/guest/QR/game/lifecycle/privacy/device flows. A static deployment check is not live-game acceptance.

Vite relative `base: './'`, bundled Kazakh fonts and hash routes preserve `/el-zhady/` refresh/navigation without server rewrites. OAuth returns to `/el-zhady/?code=…` and restores a safe hash destination. QR uses the configured real public URL. No alternate hosting provider is introduced.

## Documentation and boundaries

- [PROJECT_SPEC.md](PROJECT_SPEC.md), [REQUIREMENTS.md](REQUIREMENTS.md), [CONTENT_GUIDE.md](CONTENT_GUIDE.md): architecture, accurate completion states and content rules.
- [COMPETITION_CONTENT.md](COMPETITION_CONTENT.md): new bank claims and actually opened sources; [LIVE_QUIZ_CONTENT.md](LIVE_QUIZ_CONTENT.md): retained Stage 3 claims.
- [COMPETITION_SETUP.md](COMPETITION_SETUP.md), [COMPETITION_VERIFICATION.md](COMPETITION_VERIFICATION.md), [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md): exact manual setup, real test limits and result/privacy/deletion decisions.
- `src/data/`: public editorial plans/types; `src/auth/`, `backend/`, `features/`, `live/`: actual integration/UI. `supabase/migrations/`: versioned SQL; `supabase/tests/` and `scripts/testing/`: dev-only fixtures.

Registered history and named guest archives use internal identity snapshots, never name matches. Deleting a closed room preserves completed earned history, profiles, Auth and practice; unfinished cancelled rounds do not become completed rankings. Quiz-only totals sum correct counts/speed on the same scale, separate from practice /100. Mixed games remain unavailable until normalization/weight/speed/tie decisions are reviewed. Question draws may overlap other rounds; private API projections do not make public seed SQL cheat-proof.

The owner reports physical iPhone full-quiz/late-join/final-refresh success. Mid-question Safari answer recovery and host-tab-closed continued play remain physical checks. Preferences/reset remain cosmetic; server persistence never depends on unload. Motion supports reduced motion and no automatic audio.
