# Mixed draft status — isolated checks, not deployed

[x] Implemented and locally checked: room-wide stored unique questions; insufficient/cross-version-overlap rejection with atomic rollback; 30 quiz + 10 map + 10 timeline bank; three real live activity types; equal per-round scoring maxima; host-only target-specific early finish, normal reveals and full following timers; public atlas and reading/menu/rank first slice. [ ] Hosted setup, release and physical iPhone/Android acceptance remain pending. Practice games, five distinct completed activity types, 10 verified theses/30 verified facts/11 heroes, videos and full media goals remain incomplete. Sourced public drafts now total 13 readings, 12 events, 5 people (2 war heroes), not academically verified assessment counts. Previous checklist entries below describe earlier stages.

# Playtest update status

Checked in this slice: desktop/mobile room-code menu link; join-number removal from player lobby, own result, history and podium; stable UUID-based same-name distinction; 12 sourced readings, 12 timeline entries and 4 people across wartime/rear/postwar through 1953. These entries are not academically verified. The ten-thesis/thirty-verified-fact/eleven-hero/video/media goals remain incomplete. The permitted 1995 commemorative stamp is a credited catalogue/original link, not a hosted historical photo. Mixed games, room-wide nonrepetition and host end-question controls belong to the next draft and are not delivered by this slice. Production is unchanged.

> Latest work: competition lifecycle update on `codex/live-competition-lifecycle`, based on deployed Stage 3 `f291792`. Draft only; new migrations not applied to hosted Supabase, no merge/deploy. The historical Stage 2/3 implementation statuses below are superseded where the new matrix at the end changes the contract. Physical iPhone evidence is limited to the owner's full quiz/late-join/final-result-refresh report.

# Requirements and evidence

2026-11-01: Stage 2 is deployed; the owner reports successful Google/profile/admin/registered join and physical-iPhone guest QR/locked-room tests. Stage 3 is implemented on `codex/stage-3-live-quiz`, **not merged or deployed**. “Local checked” means code/SQL/browser evidence in STAGE3_VERIFICATION.md, not hosted service or physical-device certification. A plan/layout is not completed historical content.

## Preserved Stage 2 foundation

| Requirement | Evidence / current state |
| --- | --- |
| Public history accessible without account | Public routes ungated, independent of Supabase; content still unfinished |
| Permanent practice accounts; Google primary; no email signup | Existing PKCE/account/profile flows retained; owner reports login/refresh/logout/login success |
| Correct repository callback + destination | Existing `/el-zhady/?code=…` flow and whitelist tests retained |
| Display name creation/reuse/edit/sign-out/finite errors | Existing implementation and isolated SQL tests; owner reports profile persistence |
| Five practice slots ×20 and separate competition history | Preserved; live history now labels raw points/correct count/speed/rank; practice unchanged |

| Realtime + polling/recent activity | Safe tables only; 15s lobby polling, 25s heartbeat retained; real hosted WebSocket acceptance not repeated |
| Public URL/code/QR and advance room preparation | Existing flows retained; owner reports admin/QR/locked rejection working |
| Versioned migration/manual application | Initial SQL unchanged and not rerun remotely; reported one-time application recorded |
| Unconfigured/unreachable backend | Public shell works; bounded errors/retry; no local persistence mock |

## Stage 3 requirements

| Requirement | Implementation / actual evidence | Remaining |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Select quiz; genuine enabled Start with ≥1 other participant | Admin lobby setup, exact configured version, host exclusion; SQL/browser checked | Hosted setup/acceptance |
| Atomic roster/version freeze; lock joining | Room/session locks, private snapshots; concurrent-start/author-edit/new-entry tests | Hosted acceptance |
| 3s + 10×(15s+5s), automatic completion | Persisted start/phase; owner Cron tick + RPC repair; SQL boundary/browser flow checked | Real one-second Supabase Cron execution |
| Host independent/readable; phones full text | Host cannot answer merely by hosting; active stage scrolled into view; host tab closed/reopened in browser test | Physical HDMI/iPhone/Android |
| Identity/membership/question/option/deadline checks | Protected submission RPC; real SQL invalid/late/removed/outsider tests | Hosted JWT/PostgREST boundary |
| Exactly one answer + stable retry ack | Primary key + locks + original-ack return; first-submission races/late retry tests | Hosted latency exercise |
| Score only server: 1000 +0..100 speed | Receipt-time calculation; raw writes/extra-score calls rejected | Network/queue delay remains a fairness limitation |
| Correct count first, then speed; shared exact ranks/all tied third | SQL `rank()`; 1/2/3/3 test; podium renders every eligible rank≤3 | Hosted visual tie acceptance |
| No future questions/keys/others' answers before reveal | Private schema/revoked grants, current/reveal projections, masked board/admin review; SQL/bundle tests | Public repo seed is reviewable; not cheat-proof |
| Stable per-person shuffled options | Server permutation by participant/question/stable option IDs; SQL checked | None locally |
| Immediate save/refresh/reconnect/no host tab | SQL persisted answers + one-second state fetch, saved-answer transport-failure/browser refresh test | Actual mobile suspend/network conditions |
| Finalize once + snapshots + registered history | Serialized completion/unique result keys; concurrent finalization + guest-upgrade/no-name-link tests | Hosted acceptance |
| Admin per-question results | Reveal-gated report, answered/unanswered detail; SQL/browser checked | Hosted acceptance |
| Removed access stays revoked | Membership/RLS check on reads/submits; existing results retained; SQL checked | Hosted event timing |
| Confirmed cancellation excluded from completed ranks/history | Cancel RPC + dialog, no final rows for cancelled; SQL/browser checked | Hosted acceptance |
| Correct Kazakh leave warning; saved points/no timer reset | Hash guard + optional unload warning; browser stay/leave/return checked | Mobile unload warning is browser-dependent |
| Ten verified concise Kazakh questions/explanations/sources | Backend-only content version; actually opened sources in LIVE_QUIZ_CONTENT.md | Teacher review recommended; no full-assessment claim |
| Museum style, staged podium, reduced motion, no audio | CSS/native controls; visual/touch/keyboard/reduced-motion checks | Physical/assistive-technology audit |
| New migration(s); old immutable | Two new SQL files + separate owner Cron script; old SHA unchanged | Owner applies ONLY new files once |
| Build/type/security/multi-client tests | Local checks/build + real PostgreSQL suite + three Chromium contexts passed | Hosted/physical tests explicitly not run |
| New branch/push/PR; no merge/deploy | `codex/stage-3-live-quiz`; PR delivery in final response | Later separate release approval |

No content or function is marked complete from a plan alone. See STAGE3_VERIFICATION.md and STAGE3_SETUP.md for reproducible evidence and exact external tasks.


## Competition lifecycle update requirements

| Requirement | Actual implementation / local evidence | Remaining |
| --- | --- | --- |
| New branch from deployed main; draft/no external mutation | `codex/live-competition-lifecycle` from `f291792`, two new SQL files; old files unchanged | Hosted manual application/release not authorised here |
| Remove versus block | Distinct exact Kazakh labels/confirmations; `removed`/`blocked` identity-room state | Physical-device acceptance |
| Explicit manual rejoin only before start | `join_room` restores existing ID only on explicit join; fetch/refresh never joins | Hosted Auth/Realtime check |
| Room-only identity ban, not name ban | Private membership flag; identical names/other rooms unaffected; new identity caveat visible | No claim bans survive fresh anonymous identity |
| Late joins locked throughout competition | Frozen roster/started timestamp; unlock denied even between rounds; SQL tested | Hosted acceptance |
| Close final, participant home on live/reconnect/refresh | Open-room guard plus shared closure notice/hash exit; SQL/browser checked | Physical Safari suspend/resume |
| Closed-only permanent delete | Confirmed admin RPC; inspected explicit FK order; tombstoned QR; SQL/browser checked | Hosted owner applies new schema later |
| Preserve earned history/practice/Auth | Durable private name/UID snapshots, no room FKs; legacy/live/history upgrade/delete tests | Retention policy beyond this scope |
| Keep prepare-another-room and expected disabled field | Admin flow untouched; browser verifies disabled field and explicit reset/new preparation | None locally |
| Full-viewport projector QR | Crisp SVG, large code, X/Escape/focus return; desktop/360px browser checked | Physical QR scan after release |
| Ordered lineup/same roster | One to three real quiz rounds; unavailable other kinds; explicit ordinal transitions | Mixed games remain disabled |
| Nonfinal game results + host Next | Results saved once; host-only standings/control; players wait; no auto next | Hosted acceptance |
| Final host publication, persisted reveal | Admin-only idempotent RPC/timestamp; refresh respects it | Hosted acceptance |
| Third→second→first spotlight, ties/fewer places | Shared sequence and settled centre-first layout; browser checks tied third and two places; reduced motion skips | Physical presentation/device timing |
| Full table host only, players podium + own | RLS/admin-only raw result tables; removed result publications; filtered old/new RPCs/history; SQL attacks checked | Hosted Supabase JWT/PostgREST audit |
| Keep scoring and practice separation | Audited Stage 3 receipt-time scoring reused; quiz-only totals; practice unchanged | Choose normalization/weights/speed/ties before mixed games |
| Larger sourced Kazakh bank | Twenty private items, ten carried forward + ten newly checked; source record in COMPETITION_CONTENT.md | Teacher editorial review; narrative/media still pending |
| Ten distinct random shared-order questions per round | Saved private draw/order, stable retry/reconnect; fresh sessions vary; SQL/browser checked | No guarantee of no overlap across rounds |
| Required tests/build/docs | Types/tests/build/private bundle guard; actual PostgreSQL + separate Chromium sessions; setup guide | Hosted/physical checks explicitly pending |

A passing local fixture test is not physical iPhone or hosted Realtime/Cron verification. Mid-question Safari answer recovery and continued play with a closed host tab remain on the device checklist even though local Chromium recovery tests pass.


## Current isolated archive / solo draft (supersedes earlier practice placeholders)

| Requirement | Current checked implementation | Still pending |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Actual 1995 Мәншүк stamp | Exact Commons artifact bundled, visually inspected, credited PD-KZ-exempt; stamp/photo distinction explicit | Owner review; no deployment |
| Every currently named person portrait | Seven image-first introduction cards including Әуезов, Әлия and two context figures | Full biography/historian review; 11 heroes assessment still unfinished |
| Relevant visuals on existing substantive cards | All 13 readings and 12 events have a credited artifact or explicitly sourced original diagram | More historical content remains outside this slice |
| Classroom projection controls | Labelled optional layout preference, phone menu, persistent preference/clear exit; touch/keyboard/360px checked | Physical Safari/large classroom screen acceptance |
| Three visible timeline markers | Native >=44px buttons, explicit selected state, one-period information/filtering, keyboard/touch tests | Physical iPhone Safari |
| Five genuinely different standard solo games | Quiz, person matching, 5-event ordering, map identification, classification; server-authoritative real scoring | New migration and frontend have NOT been applied/deployed remotely |
| Result after each / combined / profile persistence | Five /20 best-score slots, /100 total; SQL-owned attempts/drafts, permanent-account gate, retry/reset; independent browser-context SQL evidence | Actual hosted Google/cross-device acceptance |
| Separate competition scores/privacy | Guest denial, foreign-owner RLS, immutable completed submission, no direct client score writes; reset preserves earned live history | Hosted acceptance after separate approval |
| Public readings / normal host and join | Public sections accessible unconfigured; normal mixed host/guest flows regression checked | Physical devices |
| Draft delivery / production unchanged | Existing isolated PR updated, original seven migration files/Pages workflow unchanged; only local disposable SQL fixtures | No merge, deployment, hosted SQL/Cron or Room A action authorised |

Evidence and limits: REVIEW_VERIFICATION.md. Rights: ARCHIVE_MEDIA.md. Assessment content is **sourced**, never marked academically verified; 10 theses, 30 facts, 11 heroes and three functioning videos are not completed by this update.
