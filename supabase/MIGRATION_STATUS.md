# Initial migration status

- Version: `20261101000100`
- File: `migrations/20261101000100_stage2_foundation.sql`
- Status: **applied manually through Supabase SQL Editor, as reported by the owner on 2026-11-01**.
- Owner reports one successful execution. **Do not rerun this migration on that project.**
- Repository-copy SHA-256 (computed locally): `55eae585c14a9708ff556a26d51c752ec456aa550f3e4930f397903bb8588ba9`.
- No direct database access was provided; execution, the database copy/checksum and remote CLI migration history have not been independently inspected.
- No migration or privileged SQL was executed against hosted Supabase by this release work. Automated tests execute the SQL only inside fresh isolated test databases.
- Before future CLI migrations: reconcile the initial version's migration history through the trusted Supabase CLI repair workflow after verifying the target project. Do not use `db push` to recreate already-applied objects, and do not mark unexecuted future migrations as applied.
- The GitHub Pages workflow builds static assets only; it never runs database migrations.


## Stage 3 manual application — owner report on 2026-11-03

| Version | File | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `20261101000200` | `migrations/20261101000200_live_quiz.sql` | Owner reports successful manual application on the existing el-zhady project; no rerun |
| `20261101000300` | `migrations/20261101000300_live_quiz_content_v1.sql` | Owner reports successful manual application on the existing el-zhady project; no rerun |

The owner reports both Stage 3 migrations succeeded on the existing project. The owner also verified both Cron jobs active, the five most recent quiz scheduler runs succeeded about one second apart, and `live_quiz_scheduler_ready()` returned true. This is the owner's hosted verification report, not independent SQL execution or inspection by the assistant. No migration or Cron setup was rerun by the assistant.

**Do not rerun any of the three applied migrations or the Cron setup.** The Stage 2 migration remains unchanged. Manual SQL Editor execution does not establish CLI migration-history reconciliation; verify the linked project/history before any future CLI workflow. On 2026-11-03 the owner authorised marking PR #3 ready, merging after green checks/no blockers, and deploying/verifying GitHub Pages. Live multiplayer/physical-device acceptance remains separate from the owner's Cron check.


## Competition lifecycle additions — manual application reported on 2026-11-03

| Version | File | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `20261103000100` | `migrations/20261103000100_competition_lifecycle.sql` | Owner reports successful manual application from commit `2bee656a78388c15d8199ab4d506ad9c3dcce943`; no rerun |
| `20261103000200` | `migrations/20261103000200_question_bank_v2.sql` | Owner reports successful manual application from the same commit; no rerun |

Both SQL Editor executions returned “Success. No rows returned.” The owner reports games stopped and Cron left unchanged. The owner supplied post-migration screenshots and confirmed all seven checks passed:

1. `public.live_competitions` exists.
2. Question bank `kz-1939-1953-bank-v2` is published with 20 questions.
3. Result-table policies have the expected administrator-only guards.
4. Realtime includes the four permitted room/session tables and excludes result tables.
5. Both existing Cron jobs are active: quiz ticks every `1 second` and log cleanup at `17 3 * * *`.
6. The five most recent quiz scheduler runs succeeded about one second apart.
7. `el_zhady_private.live_quiz_scheduler_ready()` returned true.

These are owner-supplied hosted results, not independent database access or SQL execution by the assistant. **Do not rerun these migrations, earlier migrations, or Cron setup.** CLI migration-history reconciliation remains a separate prerequisite for any future CLI migration workflow.

On 2026-11-03 the owner authorised releasing PR #4 after checking current-head migration compatibility, required CI and merge readiness, followed by verification of GitHub Pages against the resulting merge commit. This entry records setup and release authorisation; it does not claim the frontend has been deployed or that physical-device acceptance has passed.

## Mixed live challenge draft — NOT applied remotely

- `20261103000300_mixed_live_engine.sql`: new draft, isolated test databases only.
- `20261103000400_mixed_bank_v3.sql`: new draft, isolated test databases only.

No hosted application or Cron change is authorised/performed by this draft task. Do not rerun the five previously manually applied migrations or Cron setup. Later reviewed setup/release instructions: MIXED_SETUP.md. No remote migration history is inferred from local tests.


## Isolated test-project update reported by owner / solo draft

For **el-zhady-playtest (`isufimcphbxhkmrquocc`) only**, the owner reports all seven original migrations applied once manually, scheduler jobs configured/verified, anonymous Auth enabled and result-policy/Realtime checks supplied. These are owner-reported test setup, not assistant-hosted SQL access. Historical production status above must not be conflated with this isolated project. Do not rerun any of those seven files or Cron setup.

`20261103000500_solo_practice.sql` is NEW and **not applied to either hosted project** by this task. It was executed only in disposable local/CI test databases. No existing migration file was modified; no live RPC or scheduler definition is replaced. See PRACTICE_SETUP.md for later owner-reviewed isolated application. Room A is untouched. No production mutation or deployment is authorised.
